# EKG
This is an app that generate ekg signal with an opportunity to change all parameters, alternation of T pick, adding noise and filtrate it in two ways. 

For running this script you need to change all pathes to directories. All files running one by one. To run each file (exept EKG.py) you need to uncomment self.current_params and comment getting sys argument.
